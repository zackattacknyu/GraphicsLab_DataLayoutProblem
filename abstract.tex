Performance of interactive graphics walkthrough systems depend on the time
taken to fetch the required data from the secondary storage to the
main memory. It has been earlier established that a large fraction of this
fetch time is spent on seeking the data on the hard disk. In order to reduce
this seek time, redundant data storage has been proposed in the literature, but
the redundancy factors of those layouts are prohibitively high.  In this paper,
we develop a cost model for the seek time of a layout.  Based on this cost
model, we propose an algorithm that computes a redundant data layout with the
redundancy factor that is within the user specified bounds, while maximizing
the performance of the system.
