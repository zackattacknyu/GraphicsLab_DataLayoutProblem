We have shown that we have an algorithm with an efficient running time and storage space for the Data Layout Problem. It achieves significant results analytically and experimentally. When walking through an extremely detailed 3D model, this algorithm can be used to ensure that the performance will not suffer. If we give the algorithm the proper access requirements with this 3D model, then the performance will be even better.\\
\\
This leads to a logical extension of this work. Since we have a good algorithm that takes over once we know the access requirements, we should figure out how to ensure there are good access requirements to begin with. One idea on how to ensure this is to check the usage history of an application and group data units together if they are accessed together with high probability. This could even be done dynamically in the sense that after a certain amount of usage and repeating on a regular basis, you recompute the optimal access requirements and then use that to recompute the optimal layout.
