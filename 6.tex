In the algorithm, we make a list of data units that will reduce seek time by just moving instead of copying them. We perform these moves first before working with data units that need copying. This initial step will produce a better solution than proposed by \cite{cacheobliviouslayout} without adding extra units. This is because our algorithm will consider cases where data units are close to each other but in hierarchically different blocks in \cite{cacheobliviouslayout}. To show this, consider a case where we have two access requirements of 5 data units each. Figure \ref{YoonImprovement} shows an example of that kind of layout. In the middle of that figure is the result of using the cache oblivious layout. Because hierarchically it would arrange the units in each block and then arrange the blocks, it does not detect that the units with the black access requirement can be grouped together. On the other hand, the algorithm we propose would shorten the black access requirements without adding redundancy, as shown in the bottom of that figure.

The algorithm in \cite{cacheobliviouslayout} did not necessarily produce the best cache oblivious mesh layout. However, even if we had the best layout without redundancy, we would actually achieve a better seek time than it using redundancy. We have such an example with Figure \ref{fig:startingProb}. As can be seen in the figure, the total seek time is 7 units which turns out to be the minimum possible seek time without redundancy, as found through a brute-force search. With redundancy, the total seek time is the minimum required which is 6 units. While a reduction from 7 to 6 units may not seem dramatic, when this result is scaled up to the hundreds of millions, this makes a big difference in seek time, which we saw in practice.\\
