Notes for 5-5-2014:

For Lola Project:
- Add a 3D arrow for the normal vector
	- Point the arrow toward the object
- Put center of rotation around the origin so
	that as the camera moves, we will move around the
	object very easily

For Shan's Project
- Prove local optimality
- Look at the corner case that Gopi illustrated
- Prove correctness
- They approved my idea for looking at overlapping intervals
- Keep in mind that I will not be implementing it. 
	- Run time and correctness is important
- Make sure to know the stopping condition
	- It will be based on redundancy factor
	
- Gopi will talk to Bruce

Ask about Opthamology project:
- good project
