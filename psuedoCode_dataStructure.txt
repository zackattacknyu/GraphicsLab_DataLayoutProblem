For the data structure we will have a series of intervals
	and for a given interval (i,j) we will want to find the index
	with the least number of overlapping intervals. 

Either Fusion Trees or Dominance Trees will probably be the best one. 
- look at Michael Bannister's web page

The block of data will have index as well as list of ARs
The index can be a float, that way when we insert a data point, we do not have
	to update the subsequent indicies. 

Ideas:
Linear search through block
- likely not the best one in the end
